# Intelligent Lighting

An LED controller built for Raspberry Pi

### Main features:
* Control manually via a web page or the companion Android app.
* Simple API allows you to control the lights with your own scripts.
* Optional automatic control using machine learning - teach your schedule to the system and let it handle colour changes automatically based on your previous behaviour.
* Inactivity behaviours - customisable screensaver-style lighting animations that begin automatically when you haven't changed the lights for a while.
* Android notifications - pulse the lights in different colours when you get notifications from particular apps. Just like the built-in notification light on your phone, but scaled up to your whole room.
